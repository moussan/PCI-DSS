# PCI-DSS in GCP

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies to any organization that processes, stores, or transmits cardholder data, including cloud environments like **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. While PCI DSS doesn't explicitly define separate requirements for cloud platforms, the standards must be applied according to how the environment is structured and responsibilities shared between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the organization (the tenant). 

Here's a breakdown of key PCI DSS regulations and how they apply to cloud environments like GCP:

---

### **1. Shared Responsibility Model**
- **CSP Responsibilities**:
  GCP is responsible for the physical security of its infrastructure, maintaining its data centers, and ensuring the availability of its platform services. This is considered **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** and **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** responsibility.
- **Tenant Responsibilities**:
  Customers using GCP must configure services securely, manage applications, secure their own data, and implement relevant PCI DSS controls.

   **Tip**: Review the GCP **PCI Responsibility Matrix** provided to help understand what controls are shared, CSP-managed, or tenant-managed.

### **2. PCI DSS Requirements for GCP**
The following requirements apply, tailored to the cloud environment:

#### **Requirement 1: Install and Maintain a Secure Network**
- Use **firewalls and security groups** in GCP to protect cardholder data environments (CDE).
- Implement strict ingress and egress rules using **VPC Firewall Rules**.
- Use GCP’s **Cloud Armor** to prevent unauthorized network access.

#### **Requirement 2: Do Not Use Vendor-Supplied Defaults**
- Change all default credentials for virtual machines, APIs, and services (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine).
- Use custom encryption keys with **Cloud Key Management (KMS)** to control access to cardholder data.

#### **Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data**
- Use **Cloud Storage** encryption (by default) for all data at rest.
- Implement tokenization or truncation to reduce the storage of sensitive cardholder data.
- Leverage **Confidential Computing** to secure sensitive workloads.

#### **Requirement 4: Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data**
- Use **TLS 1.2 or higher** to encrypt cardholder data in transit.
- Configure **Load Balancers** and APIs to enforce HTTPS connections.

#### **Requirement 5: Use and Regularly Update Antivirus Software**
- For virtual machines, use GCP’s **OS Configuration Management** to automate installation of antivirus software.
- Monitor malware with GCP services like **Security Command Center**.

#### **Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications**
- Use GCP’s **Cloud Build** and **Artifact Registry** to automate and verify secure code builds.
- Conduct regular vulnerability scanning with **GCP Web Security Scanner**.

#### **Requirement 7: Restrict Access to Cardholder Data**
- Implement **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** roles with the principle of least privilege.
- Use **Google Workspace** or similar to monitor access to resources.

#### **Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components**
- Enforce strong authentication for administrators using **Cloud Identity** and **2FA**.
- Rotate API keys, credentials, and secrets regularly with **Secret Manager**.

#### **Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data**
- Managed entirely by GCP, as they ensure the physical security of their data centers.

#### **Requirement 10: Track and Monitor All Access**
- Use **Cloud Logging** to monitor and audit access to sensitive resources.
- Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for network-level monitoring.
- Use **SIEM** integrations to track suspicious activity.

#### **Requirement 11: Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes**
- Conduct penetration testing of your applications hosted on GCP.
- Leverage **Cloud Security Scanner** to identify vulnerabilities in your CDE.

#### **Requirement 12: Maintain an Information Security Policy**
- Ensure your internal security policies incorporate cloud-specific risks and responsibilities.
- Document the roles and responsibilities outlined by GCP’s shared responsibility model.

### **3. Specific Considerations for GCP Compliance**
1. **PCI DSS Scope**:
   - Clearly define your **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)** on GCP and isolate it from other workloads using **VPC Service Controls**.
   - Identify where cardholder data flows in the system (data in transit and at rest).

2. **Service Provider Attestation**:
   - GCP is a PCI DSS Level 1 service provider, meaning it is certified to host cardholder data. Obtain the **Attestation of Compliance (AOC)** from GCP to validate its compliance.

3. **Segmentation**:
   - Use VPC segmentation, **Private Google Access**, and firewall policies to segregate the CDE from other non-sensitive environments.

4. **Encryption Management**:
   - Configure customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or customer-supplied encryption keys (CSEK) for greater control over encryption and key rotation.

5. **Monitoring & Threat Detection**:
   - Use **Security Command Center** and **Chronicle** for real-time monitoring of threats.

### **Steps to Ensure PCI DSS Compliance in GCP**
1. **Understand GCP's Shared Responsibility Model.**
2. **Perform a PCI DSS Readiness Assessment** in your GCP environment.
3. **Leverage GCP’s PCI DSS Tools and Services**, such as IAM, VPC, KMS, and Cloud Logging.
4. **Document All Processes** for compliance audits.
5. **Engage a PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)** to validate compliance.
